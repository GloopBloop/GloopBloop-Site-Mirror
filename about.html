               <h2>About Me</h2>
               <p>I like vocal synths, especially SynthV.
                  I had always wanted to make music with lyrics but I wasn't confident in my singing, so in swooped
                  SynthV's free trial! Now I just think the singing robots are neat.<br><br>
                  On the game side of things, my favorites of all time are probably Celeste, the Splatoon series, and
                  Team Fortress 2, although I've played a lot from many genres and like most of them! Although, I
                  definitely lean toward precision games that make me question the upper limits of acceptable difficulty
                  and anything with fun movement.<br><br>
                  I made this site because I've seen a lot of really interesting Neocities sites, and I had already been
                  putting off making a place for my portfolio for a month or two. So here we are! Just you, me, the
                  HTML/CSS on this page, and probably some formatting issue I missed.

               <h2>Get into Music/Gamedev!</h2>
               <p>
                  If you've ever wanted to make music or games but felt intimidated, there's never been a better time to
                  start! For music,
                  Cakewalk is free on Windows and Reaper offers a Winrar-type trial that never actually expires, but if
                  you use it a lot please buy it, it's $60 and the license lasts forever. Meanwhile, for gamedev, Godot
                  is
                  free, Unity is free, and there are a ton of tutorials on YouTube and other places.<br><br>
                  Both hobbies can be a bit tricky to get into, but it is possible for anyone interested and they're
                  super
                  rewarding!
